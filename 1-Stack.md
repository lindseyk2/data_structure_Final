# Stack
Stack are easy to remember. The follow the "Last in, First out" (LIFO) method. Does that confuse you? Lets break it down more.

## Think about your Childhood
You come home from school and all you want to do is relax. That last a whole five minutes then you hear your mom yelling your name to unload the dishwasher full of plates. Think of the empty cabinet as an empty stack. You grab the first plate and you begin to build the stack. Each time you add a plate onto the stack that is called a **push** operation. Lucky you there was only five plates to push on the stack however, it took you long it is time for dinner and you guessed it you have to set the table with those five plates. What is the smart decision, grab the first plate you put away or the last plate you put away? If you guessed the last plate you are correct. If you did not guess that go read the stack introduction again. When you remove the plate from the stack this is called a **pop** operation. Soon you removed all the plates and now you are left with that empty stack again.
